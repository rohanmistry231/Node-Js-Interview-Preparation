# Main Learning Points: Dockerizing Node.js Apps
# Docker containerizes applications for consistent deployment.

# Use the official Node.js image
FROM node:18

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

# To use this Dockerfile in a Node.js environment:
# 1. Initialize a project: npm init -y
# 2. Install Express: npm install express
# 3. Save app.js in the project directory
# 4. Save this file as Dockerfile
# 5. Build the Docker image: docker build -t my-node-app .
# 6. Run the Docker container: docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
# 7. Visit: http://localhost:3000
# Note: This code won't execute here as Docker requires a runtime environment.
